In the image toolbox, you can now reuse metadata (license, copyright, illustrator) from the last image you edited.

### Limitations
This version has the following limitations (and probably many others). Feel free to suggest your priorities, especially if you're contributing to the Bloom project in some way :-)

* The font is always Andika (if you have it).
* All books are A5 size.
* You can't control the cover color.
* Diglots are not supported.
* Right-To-Left languages are not supported (but I haven't seen what works and what doesn't)
* If you have a pdf reader other than Adobe Acrobat set up to display PDFs in Firefox, that will also show up in the Publish tab of Bloom, and it might or might not work. PDF-XChange, for exmample, can make the screen quite complicated with toolbars, and doesn't auto-shrink to fit in the page.
* You can't tweak the picture size, the text location, etc.
