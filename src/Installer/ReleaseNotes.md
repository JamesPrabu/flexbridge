## DEV_VERSION_NUMBER: DEV_RELEASE_DATE
* FLEx Bridge: Rearchitecture work. Replace Model-View-Controller system with an action handler system that handles the various operations/actions FLEx asks to be done.
* Palaso, Chorus, & FLEx Bridge: Add localization support.

### Limitations
This version has the following limitations (and probably many others). Feel free to suggest your priorities and suggest additions to the list.

* Only works with FLEx 8+.
* Not available yet for Linux.
* Some merge reports may not be the easiest to read and understand.
* Some types of lexical relations appear to not merge correctly in both Lift data and in the main FLEx data set. The issues are more complex than merging.
See additional limitations [here](http://projects.palaso.org/projects/fwbridge/wiki/Happy_Path/).
