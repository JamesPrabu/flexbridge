## DEV_VERSION_NUMBER: DEV_RELEASE_DATE
Initial Beta release.

### Limitations
This version has the following limitations (and probably many others). Feel free to suggest your priorities and suggest additions to the list.

* Only works with FLEx 8+.
* Not available yet for Linux.
* Some merge reports may not be the easiest to read and understand.
* Some types of lexical relations appear to not merge correctly in both Lift data and in the main FLEx data set. The issues are more complex than merging.
